I am a Master’s Student in the Computer and Information Sciences program at the University of Florida (UF). I come from India and was born in New Delhi(where I spent all of my childhood). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 from IIIT Delhi in India and after graduation started working for a company called Directi in Bangalore. I enjoy watching Formula 1 and spend a lot of time learning about new technical innovations happening in the sport. I am also quite regular with gym and love to play badminton.
Directi is a domain registration and web hosting company where I worked as a back-end software en- gineer for 3 years before joining UF. As a back-end software engineer in Directi, I was responsible for the pre-purchase life cycle of a customer which includes customer signup/login, maintaining customer carts, processing payments, etc. In my time with the company, I worked on many interesting and high-revenue and customer-impacting projects like a caching service that made our application much more responsive and resilient.
I joined UF as a Master’s student in the Fall of 2021 with an aim to improve my skill set as an engi- neer and take the next step in my career. I enrolled in many interesting courses like Distributed Systems Principles, Databases Systems Implementations in my first 2 semesters at UF.
In the Summer semester of 2022, I interned at TeraInsights (https://terainsights.com) which is a company founded by Dr. Alin Dobra. At TeraInsights we are developing a product called tiCrypt (https://ticrypt.com) which allows researchers to store, share, and analyze results securely in Vault storage or virtual machines. tiCrypt is actively deployed to secure research at national labs, leading medical centers, and top R1 uni- versities. tiCrypt has security at its core and is part of every decision we take while implementing a new feature. At TeraInsights I am working on a Virtual Machine Controller which is a cross-platform application written in Go to control all the actions that happen on a Virtual Machine like changing file permissions, mounting/un-mounting new encrypted drives, transferring files, etc. I am continuing my work on this prod- uct as a part-time intern in the company in the current semester (Fall 2022). Currently, I am working on a feature where the VM Controller can add/remove ACL’s from the VM which is required when a large group (about 70 researchers in one case) are working on the same VM for a project
Since I am working on a product that essentially is all about security, I believe that this course (Computer and Network Security) will be an extremely valuable course for me to help broaden my skill set as an engi- neer in the field of security. My objective is to have a better understanding of how to prevent attacks/security breaches on a system and design systems that are resilient to adversarial attacks. One such research-paper that has caught my attention is ”End-to-end arguments in system design” which I believe aligns with my interests. Also, I have always been weak at reading and writing papers and articles, and this course feels like an opportunity to get out of that comfort zone and try to improve.
